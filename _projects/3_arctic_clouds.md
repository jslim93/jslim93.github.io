Arctic mixed-phase clouds are persistent features of the polar atmosphere, containing both liquid droplets and ice crystals. These clouds play a critical role in the Arctic surface energy budget and are notoriously difficult to simulate correctly.

### Research Focus

At CIRES, I work with Dr. Graham Feingold to investigate Arctic mixed-phase cloud stability using:

- **Lagrangian Cloud Model (LCM) simulations** that explicitly track individual hydrometeors
- **MOSAiC observational data** from the year-long Arctic drift expedition
- **Process-level analysis** of cloud-aerosol-radiation interactions

### Key Questions

- What controls the stability of Arctic mixed-phase clouds?
- How do microphysical processes influence cloud longevity?
- Can we improve climate model representations of polar clouds?
