PyLCM is an educational Lagrangian Cloud Model developed in Python, designed to help students and researchers understand cloud microphysical processes.

### Features

- **Parcel model framework** for simulating cloud formation and evolution
- **Lagrangian droplet tracking** for individual droplet histories
- **Condensation and collision-coalescence** microphysics
- **Clear, readable code** for educational purposes

### Purpose

The goal of PyLCM is to provide:

1. An accessible introduction to Lagrangian cloud modeling
2. A platform for teaching cloud microphysics concepts
3. A foundation for students to develop their own research projects

### Access

PyLCM is available on GitHub: [github.com/jslim93/PyLCM_edu](https://github.com/jslim93/PyLCM_edu)
