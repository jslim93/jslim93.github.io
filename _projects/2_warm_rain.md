Warm rain formation in shallow clouds remains one of the outstanding puzzles in cloud physics. The collision-coalescence process that produces rain is inefficient for small droplets, yet warm clouds produce rain faster than simple theory predicts.

### The Size Gap Problem

Cloud droplets typically grow to about 10-15 micrometers through condensation. However, the collision-coalescence process only becomes efficient for drops larger than ~40 micrometers. This "size gap" poses a challenge for understanding how rain forms.

### Giant Aerosols as Precipitation Embryos

Giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) and ultra-giant aerosols can serve as precipitation embryos by:

- Activating into larger-than-average droplets
- Bridging the size gap more quickly
- Initiating the collision-coalescence cascade

### Research Findings

My research investigates the critical number and size of precipitation embryos required to accelerate warm rain initiation. Using Lagrangian cloud model simulations, I have quantified:

- The threshold concentration of GCCN needed for early rain onset
- The role of turbulence in enhancing collision rates
- The interplay between aerosol properties and cloud dynamics
