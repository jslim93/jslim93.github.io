## About Me

I study cloud microphysics, focusing on how turbulent entrainment and mixing shape cloud droplet size distributions and influence precipitation. My work bridges high-resolution Lagrangian cloud modeling with observational data to improve our understanding of cloud-climate interactions.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Graham Feingold](https://csl.noaa.gov/staff/graham.feingold/) at NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, where I investigate Arctic mixed-phase cloud stability by validating the Lagrangian Cloud Model framework against observational data from field campaigns like MOSAiC.

## Research Interests

- **Entrainment and mixing** in warm cumulus and stratocumulus clouds
- **Warm rain initiation** and the role of giant aerosols
- **Arctic mixed-phase cloud** dynamics and stability
- **Lagrangian cloud modeling** at scales from millimeters to kilometers
